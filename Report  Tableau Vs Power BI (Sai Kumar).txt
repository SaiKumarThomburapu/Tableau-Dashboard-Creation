>>MY OBSERVATIONS<<

& Power BI was faster to get started with and great for building quick reports.
&Tableau offered more flexibility in terms of design and storytelling.
&Power BIâ€™s integration with Excel is a huge plus for business users.
&Tableau's drag-and-drop interface and parameter usage were more fluid for advanced visualizations.
&Data modeling was easier in Power BI using Power Query and DAX, but learning DAX took time.
&Tableau dashboards looked more visually appealing and professional.
&Publishing and sharing on Power BI was more seamless within the Microsoft ecosystem.

Based on the project, if quick deployment and cost are key, Power BI is preferable. For rich visual stories and more design flexibility, Tableau leads.
